INTRODUCTION                                    *smoosh*

This plugin adds a command and an operator for smooshing multiple lines into
one.

As a small example:
>
    foo bar
                     baz quux
             test
<
... can be smooshed into:
>
    foo bar  test    baz quux
<

This is useful for some text formatting tasks. Contents tables, such as:
>
    1 ............................................. Introduction
    2 ....................................... The Second Chapter
    3 ........................................ The Third Chapter
<
... can be built more easily with this plugin.


COMMANDS                                        *smoosh-commands*

The plugin defines just one command.

                                                *:Smoosh*
:[range]Smoosh {ignored_characters}

Smooshes the lines specified by [range] into a single line. If no range is
specified, it smooshes the line below the cursor into the current line.

{ignored_characters} represents the set of characters to ignore while
smooshing. Ignored characters will never overwrite other characters when
smooshing. By default, {ignored_characters} is " " -- the space character.


OPERATORS                                       *smoosh-operators*

The plugin defines just one operator. It is exposed as:
>
    <Plug>(smoosh)
<
... so you can add your own binding to use the smoosh operator like so:
>
    nmap YOUR_BINDING <Plug>(smoosh)
<
